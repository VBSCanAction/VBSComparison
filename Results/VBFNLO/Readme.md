Results for VBFNLO
==================

first/last bin (outside the plot range) is the underflow/overflow bin

columns:
1: lower bound
2: upper bound
3: cross section VBS
4: cross section error VBS
5: cross section Triboson
6: cross section error Triboson
7: cross section Combined
8: cross section error Combined

VBS: cross section in VBF approximation
  neglecting any s-channel contributions as well as interference between t- and u-channel diagrams
Triboson: cross section of s-channel contribution
Combined: sum of VBS and Triboson
  corresponds to full result with neglecting any interference terms between s-, t- and u-channel contributions
