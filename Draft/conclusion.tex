In the present article, a detailed study of the process $\Pp\Pp\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}\,\Pj\Pj+\mathrm{X}$ at the LHC has been presented.
The main focus is the electroweak (EW) production of such a final state where vector-boson (VBS) occurs.
So far, all NLO computations have been performed in the so-called VBS approximation.
Only recently a full computation became available \cite{Biedermann:2017bss}.
Therefore, various theoretical predictions have been compared to the full computation.
This has not only been performed in a typical VBS fiducial region but also in more inclusive volumes.
We quantify precisely the differences that arise for several physical observables and in particular for the di-jet invariant mass and the rapidity-separation of the leading two jets.
This is the first time that such a in-depth study is performed and should be representative of the quality of the approximations for other VBS signatures.
In addition to fixed order predictions we have also investigated the impact of parton-shower.
To that end, several fixed-order computations matched to parton shower have been used.
It turns out that very large differences can appear for certain observables in the central region.
These differences appear in the central region where for VBS, colour-recombination plays a significant role.
These finding are new and should trigger further investigations in the theoretical community as well as by experimental collaborations.
Indeed, measurements of such observables should allow for a better understanding of colour-recombination in parton shower.
\MP{It might be too strong a statement.}
The results presented here are exclusively theoretical.
Nonetheless, they should raise significant interests in the experimental collaborations.
Therefore, to supplement this summary, we provide several recommendations for the use of theoretical predictions for the quest of measuring VBS processes precisely.


\MP{This might deserve a section on its own.} \\
Recommendations to experimental collaborations: \\
- Stress that this is only for W+W+ but that qualitative results should apply to other VBS signatures with massive gauge bosons.
- Combinations with EW NLO corrections. \\
- Missing higher EW order: $\pm \delta^2_{\rm NLO EW}$ \\
- Systematics when using NLO QCD approximation \\
- Systematics of different parton shower \\
- Combined measurement including  EW, QCD, and interference \\
- Move to NLO predictions / generators \\
- Comment on the irreducible QCD background \\
- Uncertainties related to PDF.
