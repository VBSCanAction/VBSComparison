\caption{Cross section (fb) per bin of $(M_{jj},\,\Delta y_{jj})$ at NLO QCD $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6\alphas)$, without any cut on the $jj$ pair kinematics:  ratio of approximated squared amplitudes over the full matrix element. The approximated squared amplitudes are computed as $|\mathcal{A}|^2 \sim |s|^2 + |t|^2 + |u|^2$. Results of \texttt{VBFNLO} (approximated) and \texttt{RECOLA} (full) calculations.}\label{fig:mjjdyjj_2d_NLO}
