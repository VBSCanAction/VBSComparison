In Fig.~\ref{fig:wg1_mjj-llLO}, we show the distributions in the invariant mass of the tagging-jet (left) and lepton-pair (right).
In both cases we show the absolute distributions in the upper plot, while the lower plot displays the ratio over {\sc VBFNLO}.
For both observables we find a relatively good agreement among the various tools, which confirms the fact that contributions from $s$-channel diagrams as well as from non-resonant configurations are strongly suppressed in the fiducial region.
We have checked that the same level of agreement holds for many other differential distributions.
