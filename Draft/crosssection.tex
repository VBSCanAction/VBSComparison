 In Tab.~\ref{tab:wg1_LOrates} we report the total rates at LO accuracy obtained with the set-up described above, and in Fig.~\ref{fig:wg1_mjj-llLO} we show the results
for the tagging-jet (left) and lepton-pair (right) invariant-mass distribution. In both case we show the absolute distributions in the main frame of the 
figures, while in the inset the ratio over {\sc VBFNLO} is displayed. For both observables we find 
an excellent agreement among the various tools, which confirms the fact
that contributions from $s-$channel diagrams as well as from non-resonant configurations are strongly suppressed in the fiducial region.

At NLO, rates show slightly larger discrepancies, as it can be observed in Tab.~\ref{tab:wg1_NLOrates}. This is most likely due to low dijet invariant-mass configurations, where
$s-$channel diagrams and interferences are less suppressed than at LO, because of the presence of extra QCD radiation.
