As mentioned previously, the EW contribution is dominated by the scattering of two W gauge bosons.
Therefore it is justified to approximation the full EW contributions simply

The VBS approximation [?] is frequently employed for VBS computations and we aim at the identification of kinematical regions where it provides trustworthy prediction for the $W^+W^+$ scattering.
At LO, given the full set of diagrams contributing at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{ew}^6)$, the approximations consists in:
\begin{itemize}
\item discarding interferences between $t$ and $u$ channel diagrams, which are expected to be suppressed in the fiducial volume, after VBF cuts;
\item discarding $s$--channel diagrams shown in \autoref{fig:jjpeak_diag}, which contain $q\bar{q}'$ annihilations ($W^-\rightarrow q \bar{q}'$); with a hard cut on the $jj$--pair invariant mass, these contributions are strongly suppressed.
\end{itemize}
