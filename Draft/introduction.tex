The measurements are \cite{Aad:2014zda,Aaboud:2016ffv,Khachatryan:2014sta}.

In the last decade many codes capable of performing VBS simulations have appeared.
Within a network such as VBSCan it is therefore natural to perform 
a quantitative comparison of these codes, both to cross-validate the results and to assess the impact of the different approximations which are used.
In fact, already at LO, when considering the process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$ at order $\mathcal O (\alpha^6)$, the various implementations VBS simulations are different.
They differ, for example
by the (non-)inclusion of diagrams with vector bosons in the $s$-channel or by the treatment of interferences between diagrams.
The reason of these differences is that, 
when typical signal cuts for VBS are imposed, these effects turn to be small on rates and distributions.
