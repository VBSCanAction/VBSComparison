Vector-boson scattering (VBS) at a hadron collider 
usually refers to the interaction of massive vector-bosons ($\PW^\pm,\PZ$),
radiated by partons (quarks) of the incoming protons, 
which in turn are deflected from the beam direction 
and enter the volume of the particle detectors.
As a consequence, the typical signature of VBS events
is characterised by two energetic jets 
and four fermions,
originating from the decay of the two vector bosons.
Among the possible diagrams,
the scattering process can be mediated by a Higgs boson
and involves in particular its longitudinal component.
The interaction of longitudinally polarised bosons is of particular interest, 
because the corresponding matrix elements feature unitarity cancellations 
that strongly depend on the actual structure of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model (SM).
A detailed study of this class of processes will therefore further constrain the Higgs couplings 
at a very different energy scale with respect to the Higgs boson mass,
and hint at, or exclude, non-Standard Model behaviours.

The VBS process involving two same-sign $\PW$ bosons has the largest signal-to-background ratio of all the VBS processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC):
evidence for it was found at the centre-of-mass energy of $8~\TeV$ already~\cite{Aad:2014zda,Khachatryan:2014sta},
and it has been recently observed~\cite{Sirunyan:2017ret} and measured~\cite{Aaboud:2016ffv} 
at $13\TeV$ as well.
Presently, the measurements of VBS processes are limited by statistics, but the situation will change in the near future.
On the theoretical side, 
it is thus of prime importance to provide predictions with systematic uncertainties
at least comparable to the current and envisaged experimental precision~\cite{CMS:2016rcn}.


$\PW^+\PW^+$ scattering is also the simplest VBS process to calculate, 
because the double-charge structure of the leptonic final state 
limits the number of partonic processes and total number of Feynman diagrams for each process.
Nonetheless, it possesses all features of VBS at the LHC and is thus representative of other VBS signatures.
Therefore, it is the ideal candidate for a comparative study of the different simulation tools.

In the last few years, several next-to-leading order (NLO) computations have become available for both the VBS process~\cite{Jager:2006zc,Jager:2006cp,Bozzi:2007ur,Jager:2009xx,Jager:2011ms,Denner:2012dz,Rauch:2016pai} and its QCD-induced irreducible background process~\cite{Rauch:2016pai,Melia:2010bm,Melia:2011gk,Campanario:2013gea,Baglio:2014uba}.
All these VBS computations rely on various approximations, typically neglecting contributions which are expected to be small under realistic experimental setups~\cite{Denner:2012dz,Oleari:2003tc}.
Recently, the complete NLO corrections to $\PW^+\PW^+$ have been evaluated in Ref.~\cite{Biedermann:2017bss}, 
making it possible for the first time to study in detail the quality of the VBS approximations at NLO QCD.\footnote{Preliminary results of the present study have already been made public in Ref.~\cite{Anders:2018gfr}. 
A similar study has also been made public very recently for the EW production of a Higgs boson in association with 3 jets \cite{Campanario:2018ppz}.}

This article starts with the definition of the VBS process in Sec.~\ref{sec:definition}.
After having described the approximations of the various computer 
codes in Sec.~\ref{sec:details}, in Sec.~\ref{sec:LO} a leading-order (LO) study 
of the different contributions which lead to the production of two same-sign $\PW$ bosons and 
two jets is performed, as a function of typical VBS cuts. In the same section predictions for VBS from different tools are compared at 
the level of the cross section and differential distributions. The article continues in Sec.~\ref{sec:NLO} where the comparison is extended to the
NLO corrections to VBS. The effect of the inclusion of matching LO and NLO computations to parton shower (PS) is 
discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:matching}. Finally,
Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} contains a summary of the article and concluding remarks.
