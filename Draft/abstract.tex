In this article, a detailed study of the vector-boson scattering of two positively charged W bosons is presented.
In particular, a comparison between the full NLO QCD corrections against several approximations is carried out.
This study is not only performed in the usual fiducial region used by experimental collaborations but also in a more inclusive set-up.
This allows to infer precisely the quality of such approximations.
Finally, NLO predictions matched to various parton shower are discussed.
This study allows thus to infer the systematics related to vector-boson scattering at the NLO-QCD level and beyond.
