At tree--level, there are three contributions to the $W^+W^+$ production in association with two jets: the pure EW component $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{ew}^6)$, the QCD background $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\alpha_{ew}^4)$ and the interference $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s\alpha_{ew}^5)$.\\
Concerning the QCD contribution, it is worth noticing that for quantum numbers conservation external gluons cannot contribute at LO, thus the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\alpha_{ew}^4)$ diagrams only involve $t/u$--channel virtual gluons.\\

The three contributions to the the jet--jet invariant mass $M_{jj}$ and positive rapidity difference $|\Delta y_{jj}|$ distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mjjdyjj_1d}, together with their sum.

The interference between EW and QCD contributions is small [to be commented further]

One can also see this in three different plots in the plan $\left(m_{\Pj\Pj}, \Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}\right)$.
