At tree level, there are three contributions to the $\PW^+\PW^+$ production in association with two jets: the pure EW component $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$, the interference $\mathcal{O}(\alphas\alpha^5)$, and the QCD background $\mathcal{O}(\alphas^2\alpha^4)$.
In the present section, the cross sections and distributions are obtained without applying the VBS cuts on $m_{\Pj\Pj}$ and $|\Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}|$.
In Tab.~\ref{tab:LOscanXsec}, the cross sections of the three contributions are displayed.
The EW, QCD, and interference contributions amount to $57\%$, $37\%$, and $6\%$ of the total inclusive cross section, respectively.
The QCD contribution does not posses external gluons due to charge conservation.
Thus the $\mathcal{O}(\alphas^2\alpha^4)$ diagrams only involve gluon exchange in the $t/u$-channel between the quark lines.
This results in a small contribution although the VBS cuts have not been imposed.
The interference between EW and QCD contributions is small, due to color suppression, but not negligible ($t/u$ interference with identical fermions).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:mjjdyjj_1d} these three contributions are shown separately and summed in the differential distribution of the di-jet invariant mass $m_{\Pj\Pj}$ and the rapidity difference $|\Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}|$.
The EW contribution peaks around an invariant mass of about $80\GeV$.
These are due to diagrams where the two jets originate from the decay of a W boson (see middle and right diagrams in Fig.~\ref{diag:LO}).
Note that these contributions are not present in calculations relying on the VBS approximation.
Also, the EW contribution becomes dominant for di-jet invariant mass larger than $500\GeV$ and for jet rapidity difference larger than $2.5$.

This can also be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:mjjdyjj_2d_LO} where the three contributions are displayed as a function of the di-jet invariant mass and jet rapidity difference.
Again, it is obvious that the region with low di-jet invariant mass and low jet-rapidity difference should be avoided.
This motivates in particular the choice of $m_{\Pj\Pj} > 200\GeV$ and $|\Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}| > 2$ for our inclusive study (see below).
Finally, let us notice that the choice $m_{\Pj\Pj} > 500\GeV$ and $|\Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}| > 2.5$ made by the experimental collaborations is well motivated in order to enhance the EW contribution over its irreducible backgrounds.
This is are the cuts used in Sec.~\ref{subsec:LOfiducial}.
