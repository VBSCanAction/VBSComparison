At tree level, there are three contributions to the $W^+W^+$ production in association with two jets: the pure EW component $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$, the QCD background $\mathcal{O}(\alphas^2\alpha^4)$ and the interference $\mathcal{O}(\alphas\alpha^5)$.\\
The three contributions to the the jet--jet invariant mass $M_{jj}$ and positive rapidity difference $|\Delta y_{jj}|$ distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mjjdyjj_1d}, together with their sum.

Concerning the QCD contribution, it is worth noticing that for quantum number conservation external gluons cannot contribute at LO, thus the $\mathcal{O}(\alphas^2\alpha^4)$ diagrams only involve $t/u$--channel virtual gluons: this results in a small QCD background, although the VBF topological cuts are not imposed. The interference between EW and QCD contributions is small, due to color suppression, but not negligible ($t/u$ interference with identical fermions). The LO cross--section for the three perturbative orders are shown in table~\ref{tab:LOscanXsec}.

\end{table}
The EW, QCD and interference amount respectively to 57\%, 37\% and 6\% of the total inclusive cross section. In the presence of typical VBS cuts, the EW contribution is strongly enhanced, as shown in section~\ref{subsec:LOfiducial}.\\
The EW contribution to the $M_{jj}$ distribution (red curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:mjjdyjj_1d}) shows a huge peak around the $W$ mass: this is due to the possibility for the two jets to be decay products of a $W^-$ boson. Note that this effect doesn't arise in calculations which employ VBS approximation (see VBS approx. description in section [ref.]).
One can also see this in three different plots in the plan $\left(m_{\Pj\Pj}, \Delta y_{\Pj\Pj}\right)$.
