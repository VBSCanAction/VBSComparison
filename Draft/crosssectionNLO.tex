In Tab.~\ref{tab:wg1_NLOrates}, the cross sections of the various tools at NLO QCD accuracy are presented.
The order considered is $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^6)$.
In contrast with Tab.~\ref{tab:wg1_LOrates}, the NLO predictions seems to visibly differing according to the approximations used already at the level of the fiducial cross section.

The first observation is that the predictions featuring two versions of the VBS approximation ({\sc Bonsay} and {\sc POWHEG}) are close.
This means that the double-pole approximation on the two W bosons used in {\sc Bonsay} constitutes a good approximation of the VBS-approximated virtual corrections implemented in {\sc POWHEG}.
Both predictions differ by about $2\%$ with respect to the full computation ({\sc MoCaNLO+Recola}).
The second observation is that the inclusion of $s$-channel contributions seems to have a significant impact.
Indeed, its inclusion (as done in {\sc VBFNLO}) approximates the full computation by less than a per-cent ($0.7\%$).
The main source of the $s$-channel diagrams thereby consists of
real-emission contributions, where one of the two leading jets is formed
by one quark, or possibly also both quarks, originating from the $W$
decay, and the second one by the extra radiation emitted from the
initial state. In such configurations, the hadronically decaying W boson
can become on-shell and hence yield larger contributions than at LO, where the
invariant mass cut on the two jets forces the boson into the far
off-shell region.
